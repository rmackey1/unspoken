What remains is your actual spending money — and you can use it guilt-free because the important things are already handled. Freedom comes from structure, not from winging it."

You do not need that level of detail. You need to know three numbers: what comes in, what is committed, and what is left. Check those numbers once a month. That is it."

      "category": "Money",
      "definition": "Your spending expands to fill whatever money is available.",
      "explanation": "Coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in 1955, the original observation was about time: work expands to fill the time allotted. The financial version is equally powerful. If you have $3,000 in your account, you will find ways to spend $3,000. But if only $2,400 is visible because the rest was auto-transferred to savings, you adapt without even noticing. This is why paying yourself first works — it removes available money before your brain can claim it."

      "definition": "The part of your identity that feels threatened during disagreements.",
      "explanation": "In everyday conversation, ego refers to your sense of self-importance. During disagreements, the ego is what makes you stop listening and start defending. When someone challenges your idea, your ego interprets it as a challenge to your intelligence or worth. Separating the person from the position means recognizing that disagreeing with an idea is not the same as disrespecting the person who holds it."

      "category": "Self",
      "definition": "The ability to tolerate discomfort without immediately reacting.",
      "explanation": "Emotional resilience is not about being tough or suppressing feelings. It is the skill of experiencing uncomfortable emotions — anxiety, boredom, frustration — without reflexively reaching for a quick fix. Every time you sit through a wave of discomfort instead of numbing it, you prove to your nervous system that the feeling is survivable. Over time, your tolerance grows and your need for instant relief shrinks."

      "category": "Work",
      "definition": "Set expectations slightly below what you can actually do, then exceed them.",
      "explanation": "This is not about sandbagging or being dishonest about your capabilities. It is about building in a margin of safety so that unexpected obstacles do not turn you into someone who breaks commitments. If you think a task will take two days, say three. If you finish early, you look exceptional. If something goes wrong, you still deliver on time. Over months, this pattern builds a reputation for reliability that compounds into trust, opportunities, and influence."

      "id": "insulin-sensitivity",
      "name": "Insulin Sensitivity",
      "category": "Health",
      "definition": "How efficiently your cells respond to insulin and absorb blood sugar.",
      "explanation": "Insulin is the hormone that tells your cells to absorb glucose from the blood. When insulin sensitivity is high, a small amount of insulin does the job efficiently. When it drops — from poor sleep, stress, or diet — your body needs more insulin to achieve the same effect, which can lead to energy crashes, fat storage, and eventually metabolic disease. Even one night of poor sleep measurably reduces insulin sensitivity the next day."

      "id": "cortisol",
      "name": "Cortisol",
      "category": "Health",
      "definition": "Your body's primary stress hormone, released by the adrenal glands.",
      "explanation": "Cortisol is essential for waking up, responding to threats, and managing energy. Problems arise when it stays elevated due to chronic stress or poor sleep. High cortisol increases appetite, promotes fat storage around the midsection, impairs memory, and weakens immune function. Good sleep is one of the most effective ways to keep cortisol levels in a healthy rhythm — peaking in the morning and tapering off at night."

      "id": "melatonin",
      "name": "Melatonin",
      "category": "Health",
      "definition": "The hormone that signals your body it is time to sleep.",
      "explanation": "Melatonin production is triggered by darkness and suppressed by light, especially the blue light from screens. When you stare at your phone before bed, you are directly telling your brain to delay sleep. This is why the advice to stop screens an hour before bed is so effective — it allows melatonin to rise naturally, making you feel drowsy at the right time instead of lying awake wondering why you cannot fall asleep."

    {
      "id": "psychological-reactance",
      "name": "Psychological Reactance",
      "category": "People",
      "definition": "The instinct to push back when you feel someone is trying to control your behavior.",
      "explanation": "Psychological reactance was identified by Jack Brehm in 1966. When people perceive a threat to their freedom of choice, they experience an uncomfortable motivational state that drives them to restore that freedom — often by doing the exact opposite of what they are being told. This is why hard-sell tactics backfire, why teenagers rebel against strict rules, and why unsolicited advice is almost always ignored. The more pressure you apply, the more resistance you create."

    {
      "id": "decision-fatigue",
      "name": "Decision Fatigue",
      "category": "Self",
      "definition": "The mental exhaustion that comes from making too many choices.",
      "explanation": "Every decision you make throughout the day draws from the same limited pool of mental energy. By evening, that pool is depleted — which is why you eat junk food at night even though you planned a healthy dinner, or why you scroll your phone instead of reading. Decision fatigue explains why successful people often simplify their wardrobes, eat the same breakfast, or follow rigid routines. They are not boring — they are conserving their decision-making energy for the choices that actually matter."
    },
    {
      "id": "lifestyle-inflation",
      "name": "Lifestyle Inflation",
      "category": "Money",
      "definition": "The tendency for your spending to rise in lockstep with your income.",
      "explanation": "Lifestyle inflation is why many high earners still live paycheck to paycheck. Each raise, bonus, or new job triggers an upgrade: a nicer apartment, a better car, more expensive restaurants. The upgrades feel earned and reasonable in the moment, but they silently consume every gain. The antidote is not to avoid all upgrades — it is to decide in advance what percentage of each raise goes to savings before you adjust your lifestyle. Capture the gains before your spending can claim them."
